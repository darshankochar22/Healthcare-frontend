# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# Backend API URL (automatically set based on NODE_ENV)
# For production, this will use the deployed backend URL
# For development, this will use localhost:8000

# Note: No sensitive data should be stored in frontend environment variables
# All authentication is handled through the backend
